```
Prep:
• Come prepared with a self-introduction, you will be asked to introduce yourself.  
• Have a pencil and paper ready, because the problem may be easier if you can draw it out.  
• Have positive energy, be likeable. This one is self-explanatory.  

Coding:
• When the interviewer asks you the question, expect it to be vague and ask clarifying questions.  
•I failed an interview at a top company when I was a student because I did not ask enough clarifying questions. He told me directly at the end that I did a poor job at gathering requirements. Don’t be like me!  
• Clarify your assumptions like input value range, input value format.  
• Step through the code with a simple example.  
• Do not start to code right away, write down notes into the code editor and talk to the interviewer about your potential solution, they will usually let you know if you are going in the right direction.  
• Talk about time and space complexity if it’s an algorithm problem.  
• Talk through your code as you write it, so the interviewer can understand your thought process.  
• Do not interrupt the interviewer when they are speaking because they are usually trying to help.  
• When you feel like you’re done, you should talk about the potential trade offs and optimizations that could’ve been made given more time.  

Post interview:
• Be polite and thank your interviewer for their time.  
• Send a follow up email to thank your interviewer.
